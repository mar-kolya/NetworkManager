Description: Fix resolved detection, add stub-resolv.conf support
 Fix resolved detection, the symlink target is usually relative to the
 root, such that in chroots the file points to a file inside the
 chroot. But keep absolute targets too, as these may have been in use
 with older version of systemd.  Add support for stub-resolv.conf
 detection.
